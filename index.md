Jeremy Siek is a Professor of Computer Science in the School of
Informatics and Computing at Indiana University. Jeremy teaches
courses in programming, programming languages, compilers, logic, and
other areas of computer science. Jeremy designs new language features
to help programmers create and use software libraries and
domain-specific languages, especially generic and high-performance
ones. In particular, with Walid Taha, Jeremy invented the 
[gradual typing](./WhatIsGradualTyping.md) approach to mixing
static and dynamic type checking within the
same language. Prior to that, Jeremy co-authored the
[Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html)
and attempted to add concepts to C++. Jeremy is a member of
the [Center for Programming Systems](https://luddy.indiana.edu/research/centers/center-programming-systems.html) at IU.

# Deduce Proof Assistant

The Deduce proof assistant is an educational tool that helps students
to develop correct code. You can read about it on the [web page for
Deduce](https://jsiek.github.io/deduce/) and from a [series of blog
posts](http://siek.blogspot.com/2024/06/data-structures-and-algorithms-correctly.html)
that I have been writing.

# Phishing Scam: Research Assistant Position

There is an ongoing email phishing scam that is using my name. If you
receive an email offering you a job without first meeting with me in
person, please report it to phishing@iu.edu. Please do not send me
email to check whether it is legitimate. Thank you.

# Technology Transfer

I’ve been fortunate to see some of my ideas get used in the software industry:

* Microsoft created a gradually-typed dialect of JavaScript, called TypeScript.
* Facebook added gradual typing to PHP.
* Facebook created Flow, a static type checker for JavaScript.
* The MyPy gradual type checkers for Python.
